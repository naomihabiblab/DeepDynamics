# DeepDynamics
DeepDynamics, a deep-learning framework that combines a small reference sc/snRNA-seq atlas with large bulk RNA-seq cohorts to infer cell-type-specific and clinicopathological dynamics along annotated trajectories. 

Processes such as disease and aging are shaped by cascades of cellular changes. Mapping such cascades is critical for understanding risk and guiding intervention. 
However, bulk RNA-seq obscures cell-type resolution, whereas single-cell studies lack statistical power. 
DeepDynamics, a deep-learning framework that combines a small reference sc/snRNA-seq atlas with large bulk RNA-seq cohorts to infer 
cell-type-specific and clinicopathological dynamics along annotated trajectories. 
We applied DeepDynamics to 1,092 cortical bulk aging brain profiles to reveal cellular, pathological, and molecular mediators of Alzheiemr's disease.
By unifying genetic risk, pathology, and cell-type dynamics, DeepDynamics provides a scalable approach to prioritize putative mediators of risk and resilience 
amid the myriad changes along the cascade, thus informing targeted therapies.
